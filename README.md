Project built using dbt and a postgres database, but any other database of your choice could be used. 
The requirements are:
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run postgres and can be used for dbt as well (optional) 
- [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (optional - but a database is needed). Follow [this link](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql-macos/) for instructions on how to install and create a database. I used one database 'production' with a schema for local development 'dbt_victoria_mola' and another schema 'master' for production deployment. 
- [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) (local installation) Follow link for instructions or use a docker image from oficial [dbt repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/)

### About the data
This project is based in open data sets found in Kaggle.com: 
- [Netflix audience behaviour - UK movies](https://www.kaggle.com/vodclickstream/netflix-audience-behaviour-uk-movies) (data from year 2019 has been deleted)
- [Movies and TV Shows listings on Netflix](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

### About the project
This project is based in [dbt starter project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-starter-project) (generated by running `dbt init`)
Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test

A project includes the following files: 
- dbt_project.yml: file used to configure the dbt project, make sure the profile here matches the one setup during local installation in ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
- csv files in the data folder: these will be our sources, files described above
- Files inside folder models: The sql files contain the scripts to run our models, this will cover staging, core and a datamarts models. At the end, these models will follow this structure:

#### Execution
After having installed the required tools and cloning this repo, execute the following commnads: 

1. Change into the project's directory from the command line: `$ cd dbt-basics-workshop/complete-project`
2. Load the CSVs into the database. This materializes the CSVs as tables in your target schema: `$ dbt seed`
3. Run the models: `$ dbt run`
4. Generate documentation for the project: `$ dbt docs generate`
5. View the documentation for the project, this step should open the documentation page on a webserver, but it can also be accessed from  http://localhost:8080 : `$ dbt docs serve`
